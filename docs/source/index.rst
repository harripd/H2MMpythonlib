Introduction
============

H2MM_C is a python package that implements the |H2MM| algorithm.
This was initially designed for analyzing confocal based single-molecule FRET data to detect transitions between different states, characterizing the rate of transitions, and the FRET efficiencies.
The data comes in the form of photon arrival times, and indices to indicate at which detector the photon arrived.
While originally designed for confocal smFRET, in principle |H2MM| can be used to assess any other sort of data where data is composed of pairs of times and indices.

|H2MM| was originally developed by `Pirchi and Tsukanov et. al. 2016 <https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b10726>`_ and this package was developed by `Harris et. al. 2022 <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28632-x>`_ who also demonstrated additional statistical discriminators that clarified model selection.
If you use H2MM_C, please cite both of these papers.
For a more detailed description of the purpose and nature of |H2MM| see :doc:`AboutH2MM <AboutH2MM>`.

Installation
============

For most systems, simply typing

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install h2mm-c

into the console window will install H2MM_C.
We supply wheels built with `cibuildwheel <https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel>`_ for Python 3.7 to 3.10.
Note that you are required to have `numpy <https://numpy.org>`_ version 1.20.1 or greater to use these wheels.
On Linux distributions, older versions of numpy have incompatibilities with the size of certain data-types.
