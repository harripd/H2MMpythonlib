Like how we imported `numpy`, this is standard practice in scientific computing. \n",

    "We're also importing\n",
    "- `os` so we can load our sample datafile, its name is already so short, we just call it as `import os`\n",

    "mpH<sup>2</sup>MM is fundamentally an optimization method. It's main goal is to find the \"optimal\" **model** that describes a set of **data**. The **model** assumes the system is transitioning between a finite number of **states**. It is further assumed that the **states** are \"hidden\" and that the data instead comes in the form of a set of data points, which we will call **photons** because that is what they are when we are working with single molecule confocal data, the system for which H<sup>2</sup>MM was designed. Each **photon** has a **time** and **detector** (or **stream**) associated with it. Each **state** has a certain probability of producing a photon, in each **stream**. Usually you will have many short sequences that all represent the same system, which we will refer to as **bursts**, again, because these usually represent bursts of photons caused by single molecules diffusing in and out of the confocal volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **model** is composed of a set of arrays:\n",
    "1. The **initial probability matrix**, this is the least important array, which describes the probaility of the data beginning in each state.\n",
    "2. The **transition probability matrix**, the likelihood of one state transitioning to another\n",
    "3. The **emission probability matrix**, the likelihood of a state producing a data point in a given stream\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Optimization\" is specifically the optimization of the loglikelihood, basically, it is the likelihood that the model describes the data, so optimization is a process to find the model that has the highest, i.e. the best chance of describing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='11'></a>\n",

    "1. Load and/or process data\n",
    "2. Define an initial **model**\n",
    "3. Optimize **model** against **data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since mpH<sup>2</sup>MM is usually used for confocal burst data, the **streams** are the detectors, and data is usually composed of a set of bursts of photons. So the first step is usually taking your burst selection, and converting it into a form that `H2MM_C` can accept.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### The **data** is imported into two lists: `color` and `times`\n",
    "- `color` is a list* (it can also be a tuple) of NUMPY arrays, each array is a **burst** which contains the **stream** indices (0,1,2...) of the photons *(Note that this is not exclusively based on the **detector** as two streams may also be distinguished by the excitation period, so one **detector** might give rise to two **streams**: one for donor excitaiton, and one for acceptor excitation)*\n",
    "- `times` is a list* (it can also be a tuple) of NUMPY arrays, much like in `color` each burst gets an array, but instead of containing the **stream** indeces, these are the photon arrival times (arbitrary units). <font color=\"brown\">Make sure that the elements of `color` and `times` match, i.e. they're the same length, we'll be more specific later.</font>\n",

    "\n",
    "Now let's review what we've learned about the `h2mm_model` fields:\n",
    "1. Model Definition: these are the values that define a model:\n",
    "    - `.prior` the **initial probability matrix** is a 1D array, and has length of the number of states in the model, the sum of all values in this matrix should be 1, and none negative- it represents the probability of the system being in a given state at the beginning of a burst, so the system will be in a state at the beginning, and negative probabilities are meaningless)\n",
    "    - `.trans` the **transition probability matrix** a 2D array, both dimensions being the number of states. Each row should sum to 1, as it represents the probability that if the system is in a state, what is the probability to transition to another state, so the system must transition to a state, even if it is to the same state (in fact staying in the same state is the most likely, which is why the diagonal of this matrix is usually close to 1)\n",
    "    - `.obs` the **emission probability matrix** a 2D array with rows as the number of **states**, and columns the number of **streams** (see chapter 3, so far we have only dealt with 2 streams), the rows should sum to one, and none negative, as each row is the probability that if the system is in that state, it will emit a photon.\n",
    "2. Likelihood Estimators (calculated from **data**, `.prior`, `.trans`, and `.obs`):\n",
    "    - `.loglik`the *loglikelihood* (log of likelihood), of the model, useful for comparing two models with the same number of **states**, run against the same set of data. *Initial models (before calculation of loglik against **data**) have a value of `-inf`*\n",
    "    - `.bic` the Bayesian Information Criterion, an assessment of the likelihood of the model, with penalties for the number of **states**, allows comparison of models with different numbers of **states**, (run against the same set of data). *Initial models (before calculation of loglik against **data** will raise an error if this field is called.*\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='23'></a>\n",
    "## 2.3 Changing Values in a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "When you access the values in an `h2mm_model` object, you do not change them.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you have a new set of data, or something else, and you would like to change those values? Well, that can be done by passing an array into the field: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `model.prior = new_prior`\n",
    "- `model.trans = new_trans`\n",
    "- `model.obs = new_obs`\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE the new array must be the **same** size, otherwise an error will be raised.*\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be noted that the `H2MM_C` API automatically resets the `.loglik` to `-inf` and the `.bic` will raise a warning, when you set the value of one of these fields. This is good because the model is no longer the same, and therefore a new *loglikelihood* must be calculated. Essentially when one of these fields is set, the model should be treated as an initial model, and this is how the `H2MM_C` API treats it.\n",

We could use `model = H2MM_arr(model,color,time)`, but there is a cleaner way: the `.evaluate` method, which under the hood calls `H2MM_arr`, but  `.evaluate` is cleaner.

    "### 2.4.4 `EM_H2MM_C` vs `.optimize` and `H2MM_arr` vs `.evaluate`: They're basically the same\n",
    "\n",
    "The `h2mm_model` object method `.optimize` has basically the same function as the function `EM_H2MM_C`. <font color=\"teal\">In fact, the API uses `EM_H2MM_C` to evaluate `.optimize`. The same is true of the `.evaluate` and `H2MM_arr` function.</font> So what you can do with one, you can do with the other. Which one you use is mostly a matter of preference. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference is that when you use `EM_H2MM_C`, a new `h2mm_model` object is created, so it uses a **tiny** bit more memory, but you keep the old model around in case you want to use it again. On the other hand when you use `.optimize`, the results are returned to the original model, so you save a **tiny** amount of memory, but that original model is no longer available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `.evaluate` is also a wrapper around `.H2MM_arr`, the same principles apply, however, since the model parameters are not changed, it might seem like using `.evaluate` is the better choice unless we are wanting to compare the same model against differet **data** sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one more thing to be aware of is that the `H2MM_arr` function can also accept lists, tuples, and even NUMPY arrays of `h2mm_model` objects, and run them all against the same set of data. So it's a little more flexible in it's usage. Further, there is some preprocessing of the data that takes place before the main optimization. So if you have a lot of `h2mm_model` objects to evaluate, `H2MM_arr` will probably slightly faster, as this preprocessing takes place once if you use `H2MM_arr`, while if you `.evaluate` each model, the preprocessing will be unnecessarily repeated each for each model."

    "In [section 1.4](#wholeanalysis1), we had to define with all the arrays a new `h2mm_model` object for each number of **states** we wanted to optimize. This meant that if the system has 5 states, we'd have to define a 5<sup>th</sup> , and probably even a 6<sup>th</sup> model to be sure that 5 states is the best fit.\n",

    "It is better to define initial models based on prior knowledge of the system, but especially when we have a large number of states, or are trying to fit several different data sets, this can be rather laborious.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `H2MM_C` API contains a function to help us: `factory_h2mm_model`, which returns an initial `h2mm_model` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic signature is: `factory_h2mm_model(nstate,ndet)` where `nstate` is the number of **states** in the output model, and `ndet` is the number of **streams** in the output model.\n",

By default, the algorithm asks Python for the number of cores the machine has, and will limit itself to use only that many cores.

Therefore `os.cpu_count()` will return twice as many physical cores as there really are. If your system is not hyperthreaded, then you will want to manually specify `num_cores`. But I've found that depending on which OS/distro I'm using, how exactly it handles the parallelization differs.

To Python programmers, understand that in **C**, threads behave much more like Python processes, in that they can run simultaneously on multiple cores.</font>"
