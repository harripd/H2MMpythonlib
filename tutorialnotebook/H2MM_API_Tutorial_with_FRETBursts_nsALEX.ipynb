    "- `matplotlib` for plotting graphs so we can visualize our results, we use `from matplotlib import pyplot as plt` because it turns out that we'll only need the `pyplot` subset of `matplotlib`, and `plt` is much less wordy than typing `matplotlib.pyplot` over and over. Like how we imported `numpy`, this is standard practice in scientific computing.\n",
    "- `fretbursts` the API we will be useing to pre-process our raw data into bursts. We use `from fretbursts import *` so we all functions/classes are available without specifiend an additional `fretbursts.` identifier.\n",
    "- `H2MM_C` the API for H<sup>2</sup>MM, we use `from H2MM_C import *` so all functions/classes are available without specifying an additional `H2MM_C.` identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're also importing\n",
    "- `os` so we can load our sample datafile, its name is already so short, we just call it as `import os`\n",
    "    - Often in real analysis you will still need many of the functions in `os`, so you'll probably import `os` anyways, even if you are using FRETBursts"

    "\n",
    "mpH<sup>2</sup>MM is fundamentally an optimization method. It's main goal is to find the \"optimal\" **model** that describes a set of **data**. The **model** assumes the system is transitioning between a finite number of **states**. It is further assumed that the **states** are \"hidden\" and that the data instead comes in the form of a set of data points, which we will call **photons** because that is what they are when we are working with single molecule confocal data, the system for which H<sup>2</sup>MM was designed. Each **photon** has a **time** and **detector** (or **stream**) associated with it. Each **state** has a certain probability of producing a photon, in each **stream**. Usually you will have many short sequences that all represent the same system, which we will refer to as **bursts**, again, because these usually represent bursts of photons caused by single molecules diffusing in and out of the confocal volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **model** is composed of a set of arrays:\n",
    "1. The **initial probability matrix**, this is the least important array, which describes the probaility of the data beginning in each state.\n",
    "2. The **transition probability matrix**, the likelihood of one state transitioning to another\n",
    "3. The **emission probability matrix**, the likelihood of a state producing a data point in a given stream\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Optimization\" is specifically the optimization of the loglikelihood, basically, it is the likelihood that the model describes the data, so optimization is a process to find the model that has the highest, i.e. the best chance of describing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='11'></a>\n",
    "## 1.1 Run Analysis\n",
    "So, the basic process is:\n",
    "1. Load and/or process data\n",
    "2. Define an initial **model**\n",
    "3. Optimize **model** against **data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since H<sup>2</sup>MM is usually used for confocal burst data, the **streams** are the detectors, and data is usually composed of a set of bursts of photons. So the first step is usually taking your burst selection, and converting it into a form that `H2MM_C` can accept.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='111'></a>\n",
    "### 1.1.1 Load Data\n",
    "#### First, we need some data, let's load it from the provided file:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We must first load the data, in this tutorial, we will use data that has been distributed in the open photon-HDF5 format.\n",
    "    - This data has note been separated into bursts, so we must first process the data to find the bursts.\n",
    "- This tutorial will use the python package <a href=\"https://fretbursts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">FRETBursts</a>\n",
    "    - This is not intended as a tutorial of FRETBursts. As such only the minimal commands are given to properly find and select the bursts. These have been verified to be valid for the data supplied, **BUT** if you are using your own data, you should also plot various photon statistics and modify the values accordingly to verify that your data has both sufficiently low background levels, and your burst selection is valid for your data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The **data** is imported into two lists: `color` and `times`\n",
    "- `color` is a list* (it can also be a tuple) of NUMPY arrays, each array is a **burst** which contains the **stream** indices (0,1,2...) of the photons *(Note that this is not exclusively based on the **detector** as two streams may also be distinguished by the excitation period, so one **detector** might give rise to two **streams**: one for donor excitaiton, and one for acceptor excitation)*\n",
    "- `times` is a list* (it can also be a tuple) of NUMPY arrays, much like in `color` each burst gets an array, but instead of containing the **stream** indeces, these are the photon arrival times (arbitrary units). <font color=\"brown\">Make sure that the elements of `color` and `times` match, i.e. they're the same length, we'll be more specific later.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"brown\">*For those coming from Matlab, Python lists are very similar to Matlab Cell Arrays, Python tuples are similar, except that they cannot be changed after their creation.</font>\n",

    "Remember that it was mentioned that the optimization of `EM_H2MM_C` doesn't change the number of **states**? This is important, because unless you know for sure that there are $n$  **states**, models with different numbers of **states** should be optimized and then compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "So use it is generally better to proceed as follows:\n",
    " 1. Define several **models** with different numbers of **states**\n",
    " 2. Run optimization on **data** using all **models**\n",
    " 3. Compare optimized **models** and select the best one\n",
    "\n",
    "How to compare the models? Don't just choose the model you \"like,\" rather, it's best to use a statistical discriminator (or several). The *loglikelihood* however, is not a good discriminator. Generally speaking, it is good only for comparing models with the same number of states. Models with more states basically always have better *loglikelihoods.* But there are ways to make working statistical discriminators. \n",

    "\n",
    "The *Bayes Information Criterion* ($BIC$), which penalizes the *loglikelihood* based on the number of free parameters (related to the number of *states*, and factoring in the number of **streams**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the statistical definition of the $BIC$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ BIC = -2 LL + K \\ln(n)$\n",

    "Where $LL$ is the *loglikelihood*, $K$ is the number of free parameters, and $n$ is the number of **photons** in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the $BIC$ is based purely on the *loglikelihood* and the data against which the **model** was optimized, the $BIC$ is a field available in the `h2mm_model`: accessed through `.bic`\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='132'></a>\n",
    "### 1.3.2 Integrated Complete Likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Integrated Complete Likelihood* ($ICL$) is basically the same, but based on the *loglikelihood* not of the **model**, but rather of the *most likely state path* based on the *Viterbi* algorithm.\n",

    "$ ICL = -2 LL_{Viterbi} + K \\ln(n)$\n",

    "We find the $ICL$ is a better discriminator that $BIC$. Unfortunately, unlike the $BIC$, since $ICL$ is based on the *most likely state path*, it requires running `viterbi_path` or `viterbi_sort`, and is therefore not a field in the `h2mm_model` object.\n",

    "- `sub`: an integer indicating how many bootstrap sets to use (this should be choosen to balance time and accuracy, larger numbers take more time but are more accurate to a point\n",
    "- `**kwargs`: these are passed to the `EM_H2MM_C` function without modification (we'll get to kwargs later, see [Apendix (section 9.2)](#92) for a descrition of these options, these will be introduced in other parts of the tutorial as well."

    "\n",
    "Now let's review what we've learned about the `h2mm_model` fields:\n",
    "1. Model Definition: these are the values that define a model:\n",
    "    - `.prior` the **initial probability matrix** is a 1D array, and has length of the number of states in the model, the sum of all values in this matrix should be 1, and none negative- it represents the probability of the system being in a given state at the beginning of a burst, so the system will be in a state at the beginning, and negative probabilities are meaningless)\n",
    "    - `.trans` the **transition probability matrix** a 2D array, both dimensions being the number of states. Each row should sum to 1, as it represents the probability that if the system is in a state, what is the probability to transition to another state, so the system must transition to a state, even if it is to the same state (in fact staying in the same state is the most likely, which is why the diagonal of this matrix is usually close to 1)\n",
    "    - `.obs` the **emission probability matrix** a 2D array with rows as the number of **states**, and columns the number of **streams** (see chapter 3, so far we have only dealt with 2 streams), the rows should sum to one, and none negative, as each row is the probability that if the system is in that state, it will emit a photon.\n",
    "2. Likelihood Estimators (calculated from **data**, `.prior`, `.trans`, and `.obs`):\n",
    "    - `.loglik`the *loglikelihood* (log of likelihood), of the model, useful for comparing two models with the same number of **states**, run against the same set of data. *Initial models (before calculation of loglik against **data**) have a value of `-inf`*\n",
    "    - `.bic` the Bayesian Information Criterion, an assessment of the likelihood of the model, with penalties for the number of **states**, allows comparison of models with different numbers of **states**, (run against the same set of data). *Initial models (before calculation of loglik against **data** will raise an error if this field is called.*\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='23'></a>\n",
    "## 2.3 Changing Values in a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "When you access the values in an `h2mm_model` object, you do not change them.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you have a new set of data, or something else, and you would like to change those values? Well, that can be done by passing an array into the field: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `model.prior = new_prior`\n",
    "- `model.trans = new_trans`\n",
    "- `model.obs = new_obs`\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE the new array must be the **same** size, otherwise an error will be raised.*\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be noted that the `H2MM_C` API automatically resets the `.loglik` to `-inf` and the `.bic` will raise a warning, when you set the value of one of these fields. This is good because the model is no longer the same, and therefore a new *loglikelihood* must be calculated. Essentially when one of these fields is set, the model should be treated as an initial model, and this is how the `H2MM_C` API treats it.\n",

    "### 2.4.4 `EM_H2MM_C` vs `.optimize` and `H2MM_arr` vs `.evaluate`: They're basically the same\n",
    "\n",
    "The `h2mm_model` object method `.optimize` has basically the same function as the function `EM_H2MM_C`. <font color=\"teal\">In fact, the API uses `EM_H2MM_C` to evaluate `.optimize`. The same is true of the `.evaluate` and `H2MM_arr` function.</font> So what you can do with one, you can do with the other. Which one you use is mostly a matter of preference. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference is that when you use `EM_H2MM_C`, a new `h2mm_model` object is created, so it uses a **tiny** bit more memory, but you keep the old model around in case you want to use it again. On the other hand when you use `.optimize`, the results are returned to the original model, so you save a **tiny** amount of memory, but that original model is no longer available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `.evaluate` is also a wrapper around `.H2MM_arr`, the same principles apply, however, since the model parameters are not changed, it might seem like using `.evaluate` is the better choice unless we are wanting to compare the same model against differet **data** sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one more thing to be aware of is that the `H2MM_arr` function can also accept lists, tuples, and even NUMPY arrays of `h2mm_model` objects, and run them all against the same set of data. So it's a little more flexible in it's usage. Further, there is some preprocessing of the data that takes place before the main optimization. So if you have a lot of `h2mm_model` objects to evaluate, `H2MM_arr` will probably slightly faster, as this preprocessing takes place once if you use `H2MM_arr`, while if you `.evaluate` each model, the preprocessing will be unnecessarily repeated each for each model."
